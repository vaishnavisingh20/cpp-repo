## Introduction

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used for various applications, including game development, system programming, and embedded systems. This repository serves as a personal journal and knowledge base as I embark on my C++ learning journey. Here, you will find my code samples, notes, and reflections as I progress in my learning.

## Learning Resources

I will be using a variety of resources to learn C++. Here are some of the key resources I'll be using:

- **Online Courses**:
  - [Coursera - C++ for C Programmers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-for-c-programmers)
  - [Udemy - Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++](https://www.udemy.com/cplusplus-beginner-to-advance/)
- **Books**:
  - "Accelerated C++" by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo
  - "C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo
- **Online Documentation**:
  - [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

## Progress

I will use this section to document my progress and keep track of the topics I've covered, exercises I've completed, and any challenges I've faced. It will help me track my learning journey and serve as a reference for others who might be following a similar path.

- **Month 1**:
  - Completed basic C++ syntax and concepts.
  - Started working on simple console applications.
- **Month 2**:
  - Dived into object-oriented programming in C++.
  - Began exploring the Standard Template Library (STL).
- **Month 3**:
  - Advanced C++ topics like templates, operator overloading, and exception handling.
  - Started building a small project (TBD).

## Projects

In this section, you will find the projects I'm working on as part of my C++ learning journey. These projects will demonstrate my practical application of the concepts I'm learning.

- **Project 1** - "Simple Calculator":
  A basic command-line calculator that can perform arithmetic operations.
- **Project 2** - "Library Management System":
  A more advanced project to manage books in a library, utilizing object-oriented principles.
- **Project 3** - (TBD):
  A project to be announced, focusing on specific C++ concepts and application.

Please explore these projects, provide feedback, or use them as a reference for your own learning journey.
